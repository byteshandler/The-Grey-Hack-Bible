# ❓ FAQ

If you're asking these questions, good. It means you actually care about learning instead of blindly copying commands.

---

### **Who is this for?**

Anyone who wants to move past being a script kiddie and actually understand how Grey Hack – and real hacking concepts work under the hood.

---

### **Do I need prior experience?**

No. But if you have some command line or networking knowledge, you’ll progress faster. Either way, start from the foundations. Skip them and you’ll regret it later.

---

### **Is this about real hacking?**

Grey Hack is a sandbox game, but everything here is rooted in real methodologies and thinking patterns used by hackers. Learn it here, apply it ethically in real life.

---

### **Why is the tone so toxic?**

Because hand-holding creates weak hackers. You’re here to build real skills, not get participation trophies.

---

### **Will you add more scripts, exploits, and resources here?**

Always. This Bible will grow as Grey Hack updates and as my own toolkit expands. Check back regularly or contribute if your work is worth sharing.

---

### **Can I contribute to this bible?**

Check the [Contributing section in README.md](../../README.md#-contributing). Follow the structure, keep it clean, and don’t waste my time with garbage commits.

---

### **Can I skip singleplayer and jump into multiplayer immediately?**

Sure, if you want to get hacked within your first hour online. Master singleplayer first! Multiplayer is a hunting ground – you’re either prepared, or you’re prey.
