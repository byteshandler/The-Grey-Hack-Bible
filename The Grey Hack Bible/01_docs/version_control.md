# 🗃️ Version Control

## 💡 What is this?

This isn’t a Git tutorial.
This section exists to track **how I manage versions of The Grey Hack Bible** and to remind you:

**This guide is not finished.**
I update it whenever I feel it’s ready to expand – no fixed schedule, no promises.

**Current version**
WIP - 1.0

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This Bible is a work in progress.
- Some sections might be incomplete, placeholders, or reorganised over time.
- Don’t treat it as a final polished product – treat it as a living resource that grows.
- I’m still figuring out the final structure. Heavy changes may occur in the future.

## 🔧 How I manage versions

- I push major updates with clear commit messages summarising what changed.
- Minor typo fixes or formatting tweaks are pushed without detailed logs.
- Each major structural change or file addition has a descriptive commit title and body for easy navigation in GitHub history.

> **Final note:** If you see something missing, it’s probably planned for a future update. I’d rather release it unfinished than keep it hidden forever. For feedback, pm me on discord: bytehandler
