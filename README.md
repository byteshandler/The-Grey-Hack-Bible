# The Grey Hack Bible

The Grey Hack Bible – if you’re tired of dogshit guides written by clueless retards and want real knowledge, and real domination like a fucking nerd.

---

## ✨ Why this Bible exists

Because **half-baked guides and scattered notes waste your fucking time**.  
Most Grey Hack tutorials are pasted from forums by retarded pasters who think running `viper` makes them a good hacker, leaving you with zero knowledge – don't be a skid.

This Bible exists to:

- Teach you **how to use commands effectively, enumeration, and how/why scripts work**
- Show you **how to think, adapt, and operate like a hacker**, not just follow steps like a sheep
- Save you from wasting time on low-effort forum posts and recycled YouTube tutorials
- Provide scripts, logic, and strategies to progress efficiently and effectively

If you’re here to **copy-paste exploits without understanding them**, this isn’t for you, I don't want you here.
If you’re here to **master Grey Hack as a tool, game, and platform for learning real methodology**, then read on.

## 🕷️ Who am I?

I’m **bytehandler**.

- Reverse engineer
- Exploit dev
- Builder and breaker of systems

I don’t play Grey Hack to roleplay. I play it because watching skids struggle is free entertainment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone it. Read it. Understand it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byteshandler/The-Grey-Hack-Bible.git
cd The-Grey-Hack-Bible
```

## 📚 Structure

The current structure is **likely temporary and will evolve** as this Bible expands.

Right now, it’s organised into:

- **Docs** – general documentation, glossaries, and learning paths
- **Foundations** – commands, tools, and efficient navigation
- **Singleplayer basics** – initial progression, first missions, and systems
- **Multiplayer basics** – transitioning, staying secure, and practical tasks
- **Advanced topics** – scripting, automation, and actual efficient workflows
- **Resources** – GreyScript references, external notes, and useful materials

As content grows, structure will adapt to remain **clean, fast to navigate, and not a cluttered skid wiki**.
